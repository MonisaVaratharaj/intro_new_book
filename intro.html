<p> Hey guys! Hope you're all doing great! <br> 

In this blog, I am going to logically demonstrate why relying solely on your job might not guarantee the safety and security you seek. To make this idea clearer, I’ll use a simple yet powerful illustration that highlights the potential risks and limitations of traditional employment. </p> <br>
    <p>Let A be a person who is a house owner, receiving monthly house rent of one lakh.<br>
    Let B be a person who runs a hotel and earning one lakh per month.<br>
    Let C be a person who is having a job (let's say general manager of a company) and receiving a salary of one lakh per month.<br>
    I will talk about D later.</p>

<p><em> If you are using mobile,use desktop site view, to have a look at the  entire table </em> </p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Asset for A is the house he owns, asset for B is the hotel, asset for C is just the job he is working. D will be discussed later.</p>

   <p><strong>INACTIVE : </strong></p>
<p>Let's imagine a scenario where individuals A, B, C, and D are the sole breadwinners of their families. Now, let's say they all experience an accident, get hurt, and are advised to take bed rest for about three months. (This is just a hypothetical situation to illustrate the point of inactivity, not meant negatively. Alternatively, we can consider that these individuals simply can't work anymore.)</p>
<p>Despite being inactive, person A still earns money each month because he owns a house. Even though he can't work, he continue to receive rent payments from tenants.</p>
<p>Similarly, person B also earns money every month, as he runs a hotel. The hotel can be managed by other people, so the income continues even if person B cannot actively work.</p>
<p>However, person C cannot earn any money during this period, as he depends on a single job and unable to work while recovering.</p>
<p>Person D also becomes inactive, but he continues to earn the same amount of money, possibly due to a source of passive income or other means that don't require their active involvement.</p>

<p><strong>HOTCASH:</strong></p>
<p>Let's consider another scenario where all four individuals urgently need a large sum of money for a purpose such as a wedding, medical expenses, etc. Can A arrange the amount within a short period of time? Yes, A can. He can arrange the money using his property—the house.</p>
<p>What about B? Yes, B can also arrange the bulk cash, as he owns some property that can be leveraged.</p>
<p>What about C? C cannot arrange any bulk cash. All he has is his job, and he cannot quickly access a large sum of money through it (excluding loans, as we're talking about instant cash).</p>
<p>What about D? Yes, D can arrange the required bulk cash if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSFER/SELL:</strong></p>
<p>In this case, people may want to sell or transfer their ownership to the next generation. Obviously, A can do this—he can transfer the ownership of the house he owns to his son or daughter.</p>
<p>The same applies to person B; he can transfer ownership of his hotel to his family.</p>
<p>What about C? Take a moment to think: Can a person sell their job when he wants? Or transfer it to his son or daughter whenever he wish?</p>
<p>For person D, yes, D can sell his asset, transfer it to his next generation, and has the ability to sell his asset whenever needed.</p>

<p><strong>GROWTH:</strong></p>
<p>The house rent can increase if we own more houses and rent them out. However, this requires an investment. But once the investment is made, there will be an increase in monthly income.</p>
<p>Person B: Naturally, if he invests more, he will earn more. However, he still needs to make an investment to see returns.</p>
<p>Person C: He doesn't have the opportunity to invest, so there will be no growth. This is not about annual increments; I am referring specifically to personal investments.</p>
<p>Person D: He has the potential for growth if he chooses to invest more.Once the foundation becomes stronger, there is no need to invest anymore.</p>

 <p><strong>GROWTH RATE:</strong></p>
<p>The growth rate for a house owner who invests would be in addition. For example, if he earns 1 lakh a month, owning two houses would help him earn 2 lakh a month.</p>
<p>For person B, the growth rate would be in multiplication. While I may not be fully versed in all business logics, let's assume the hotel business grows either in addition or multiplication with investment.</p>
<p>For person C, there is no opportunity for investment, so there is no potential for growth.</p>
<p>For person D, the growth would be exponential with more investment.</p>

   <p><strong>MENTORSHIP:</strong></p>
<p>For person A and person B - they may or may not have mentors.</p>
<p>For person C - he may or may not have mentor.</p>
<p>But for person D, having a mentor is almost certain.</p>

<p>Take your time to analyze what you've learned here. What insights did you gain? Feel free to share them with me.(This cheers me a lot!) </p>

    <p>Okay, let me explain my point of view. In most cases, person A and person B have certain advantages. They can invest money in their assets, grow those assets, and maintain a steady cash flow. They can even sell their assets when needed or transfer ownership to the next generation, according to their wishes.</p>
<p>But for person C, here's where most people get it wrong—about 90 percent of people fall into this category. They only own a job and earn a monthly salary. That's it. They can't sell their job when necessary, they can't pass it on to their children, and they can't invest or see any growth in their income. If they become inactive, there will be no money, no cash flow.</p>
<p><strong> NOW WHO IS AT HIGHER RISK ? </strong> <br> <br>
I'm not trying to frighten anyone, but it's important to understand the reality that everyone should recognize.</p>
<p>Having a job and earning a monthly income will not save you during emergencies, and after 40-50 years of service, you might be left with nothing.</p>
<p>Imagine being in a job, doing exactly what I just described, and then retiring. What would the scenario look like? Think about it.</p>

<p>Now, the most crucial person is D, who has all the opportunities and benefits. D owns an asset, earns the same income, but also has the capacity to arrange hotcash, transfer ownership, invest, and make growth. However, the growth rate here is not simply addition or multiplication—it’s exponential. D also has a strong mentor who guides him every step of the way in building his own asset. Even if person D becomes inactive, he still earns money through his asset.</p>

<p><b> Note:</b> D is a passive income opportunity that anyone in society can take advantage of—exciting, isn't it? Whether you're employed full-time, earning an active income, or even a student, this is something everyone can do with minimal or no investment. <br> <br> 
So, who is D? What is D's asset? Aren’t you curious? Keep your excitement in check—I will talk about D in my next blog. Until then, remember this: think and stay curious...</p>

<b> <p>The answer for D will definitely be posted only on Instagram. Don't miss out! Follow my Insta ID for the next update: </b><br>
