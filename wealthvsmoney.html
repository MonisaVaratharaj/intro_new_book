      <h2>Wealth vs Money</h2>
      <p><span class="highlight">Money</span> is not the same as <span class="highlight">wealth</span>.</p>
      <p><strong>Money</strong> is how we transfer wealth. Money is social credits. It is the ability to have credits and debits of other people’s time. If I do my job right, if I create value for society, society says, “Oh, thank you. We owe you something in the future for the work you did in the past. Here’s a little IOU. Let’s call that money.”</p>
      <p><strong>Wealth</strong> is the thing you want. Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. Wealth is the factory, the robots, cranking out things.</p>
      <p>Wealth is the computer program that’s running at night, serving other customers. Wealth is even money in the bank that is being reinvested into other assets, and into other businesses. Even a house can be a form of wealth, because you can rent it out, although that’s probably a lower productivity use of land than some commercial enterprise.</p>
      <p>So, my definition of wealth is much more businesses and assets that can earn while you sleep, while you eat, while you play golf—simply we say: wealth generates money even when you're not actively involved.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-content">
      <h3>Let’s Say You Earn ₹1,000 Per Month</h3>
      <p>Let’s assume you earn ₹1,000 per month, save ₹500, and spend ₹500 (taken for simplicity) – we are going to calculate the tax and inflation rate.</p>
     
      <h4>What is the Inflation Rate?</h4>
      <p>The inflation rate is the percentage increase in the prices of goods and services over a specific period, typically measured annually. It reflects the decline in the purchasing power of money—meaning that over time, you can buy fewer goods with the same amount of money.</p>
      <p>For example, if the inflation rate is 6%, an item that costs ₹100 today would cost ₹106 next year.</p>

      <h4>Why Does Inflation Happen?</h4>
      <p>Inflation occurs due to various economic factors, broadly categorized as demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, or built-in inflation. We are not focusing on this, let's calculate only the inflation rate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-content">
      <h3>Step-by-Step Calculation</h3>

      <div class="section-title">Step 1: Income Tax Calculation</div>
      <p>Assume you're under the new tax regime in India for FY 2023-24.</p>
     
      <h4>Tax Slabs (New Regime):</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>₹0 to ₹3 lakhs: No tax</li>
        <li>₹3 lakhs to ₹6 lakhs: 5% of the income exceeding ₹3 lakhs</li>
        <li>₹6 lakhs to ₹9 lakhs: 10% of the income exceeding ₹6 lakhs</li>
        <li>₹9 lakhs to ₹12 lakhs: 15% of the income exceeding ₹9 lakhs</li>
        <li>₹12 lakhs to ₹15 lakhs: 20% of the income exceeding ₹12 lakhs</li>
        <li>Above ₹15 lakhs: 30% of the income exceeding ₹15 lakhs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since ₹12,000 annually is well below ₹3,00,000, you pay zero income tax.</p>

      <div class="section-title">Step 2: Post-Tax Income</div>
      <p>Since there is no tax deduction:</p>
      <p><strong>Monthly Post-Tax Income:</strong> ₹1,000 (no tax is deducted from ₹1,000)</p>

      <div class="section-title">Step 3: Savings and Inflation Impact</div>
      <p>You save ₹500 per month, which totals ₹6,000 annually. If you deposit this in a bank savings account earning 4% interest:</p>
      <p><strong>Interest Earned:</strong> ₹6,000 × 4% = ₹240</p>
      <p><strong>Total Savings with Interest:</strong> ₹6,000 + ₹240 = ₹6,240</p>
     
      <p><strong>Adjusting for Inflation (6% annually):</strong></p>
      <p>Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money by 6%.</p>
      <p><strong>Value Lost Due to Inflation:</strong> ₹6,240 × 6% = ₹374.40</p>
      <p><strong>Real Value of Savings After Inflation:</strong> ₹6,240 – ₹374.40 = ₹5,865.60</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-content">
      <h3>Interpretation in Terms of Purchasing Power</h3>
      <p><strong>Year 1:</strong> ₹6,240 could buy the full basket of goods.</p>
      <p><strong>Year 2:</strong> ₹6,240 is insufficient to buy the same basket of goods; the real value of money is now only ₹5,865.60. Even though your money is still ₹6,240, you can only purchase items worth ₹5,865 because your purchasing power has decreased over time.</p>

      <p>The 6% inflation effectively reduced the purchasing power of your money, even though the savings amount remained unchanged.</p>
     
      <h3>Impact of Inflation Over Multiple Years</h3>
      <p>If inflation continues year after year, the purchasing power of your money will keep declining unless your savings grow at the same or higher rate.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Year 1 Real Value:</strong> ₹6,240</li>
        <li><strong>Year 2 Real Value:</strong> ₹5,865.60</li>
        <li><strong>Year 3 Real Value (assuming another 6% inflation):</strong> ₹5,865.60 × 0.94 = ₹5,513.66</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This demonstrates how inflation eats away at the value of your money over time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <p><strong>Insights:</strong> Building wealth and assets is essential to beat inflation and maintain or grow your purchasing power over time. Simply saving money in a low-interest bank account is often not enough, as inflation can erode its value.</p>
