 <h1>THE POWER - RHONDA BYRNE</h1>
        <h2>You are meant to have an amazing life! </h2>

        <p>You are meant to have everything you love and desire. 
Your work is meant to be exciting, and you are meant to 
accomplish all the things you would love to accomplish. Your 
relationships with your family and friends are meant to be 
filled with happiness. You are meant to have all the money you 
need to live a full, wonderful life. You are meant to be living 
your dreams - all of them. If you want to travel, you are meant 
to travel. If you would love to start a business, you are meant 
to start a business.</p>

<p>If you would love to be a musician, a scientist, a 
business owner, an inventor, a performer, a parent, or whatever 
it is you would love to be, you are meant to be it! 
When you wake up each day, you should be filled with 
excitement because you know the day is going to be full of 
great things. You are meant to be laughing and full of joy. You 
are meant to feel strong and safe. You are meant to feel good 
about yourself and know you're invaluable. Of course there 
will be challenges in your life, and you are meant to have them 
too, because they help you to grow, but you are meant to know 
how to overcome problems and challenges. <b>You are meant 
to be victorious! You are meant to be happy! You are meant 
to have an amazing life! </b></p>

        <p><b> You were not born to struggle.You were not born to live with a lack of money or health.
 You were not born to be worried or stressed. You were not born to suffer. </b>What would be the point of your life? You 
are meant to experience life to its fullest and have everything 
you want and, at the same time, be filled with joy, health, 
vitality, excitement, and love, because that is an amazing life! </p>

        <p> Life is so much easier than you think , as you come to understand the way life works, 
and the power you have inside you !</p>

        <h2>Life is simple</h2>
        <p> Your life is made up of only two kinds of 
things - positive things and negative things. Each area of 
your life, whether it's your health, money; relationships, work, 
or happiness, is either positive or negative to you. You have 
plenty of money or you lack money. You are brimming with 
health or you lack health. Your relationships are happy or 
difficult. Your work is exciting and successful or dissatisfying 
and unsuccessful. </p>

<p>You are filled with happiness or you don't 
feel good a lot of the time. You have good years or bad years, 
good times or bad times, good days or bad days. 
If you have more negative things than positive things 
in your life, then something is very wrong and you know it. </p>
<p> 
You see other people who are happy and fulfilled and whose 
lives are full of great things, and something tells you that you 
deserve all that too. And you're right; you do deserve a life 
overflowing with good things.</p>

        <p><span class="important">The power to have all the positive and good 
things in life is love! 
Love has been talked about and written about since 
the beginning of time, in every religion, and by every great 
thinker, philosopher, prophet, and leader. But many of us have 
not truly understood their wise words. Even though their 
teachings were specifically for people in their time, their one 
truth and message to the world is still the same today: love, 
because when you love you are using the greatest power in 
the universe.
</span></p>
        <h2>Love is not weak 
or soft. </h2>

        <p>Love is the positive force of life! Love is the cause 
of everything positive and good. There are not a hundred 
different positive forces in life; there is only one. 
Nature's great powers, like gravity and electromagnetism, 
are invisible to our senses, but their power is indisputable. 
Likewise, the force of love is invisible to us, but its power of 
is in its fact power far can greater be seen than everywhere any of nature's 
in the powers. </p>

        

        <h2>The evidence - Without love, there is no life. </h2>

        <p>
Take a moment to think about it: What would the world 
be without love? First of all, you wouldn't even exist; without 
love you couldn't have been born. None of your family and 
friends would have been born either. In fact, there wouldn't 
be a single human being on the planet. If the force of love 
ceased today, the entire human race would decrease and 
eventually die out. </p>

        <p>Every single invention, discovery, and human creation 
came from the love in a human heart. If it were not for the 
love of the Wright Brothers, we could not fly in an airplane. 
If it were not for the love of scientists, inventors, and 
discoverers, we would not have electricity, heating, or light; 
nor would we be able to drive a car or use a phone, appliance, 
or any of the technology that makes life easier and more 
comfortable. Without the love of architects and builders, 
there would be no homes, buildings, or cities. Without love, 
there would be no medicines, doctors, or emergency facilities. 
No teachers, schools, or education, because all of these things are 
created from the positive force of love. </p> 

<p>Take a look around you 
right now. Whatever you see that is a human creation would 
not be there without love.<b>The positive force of love can create anything 
good, increase the good things, and change anything negative 
in your life. You have the power over your health, your wealth, 
your career, your relationships, and every area of your life. 
And that power - love - is inside you! </b></p>

        <p>
<b> But if you have the power over your life, and that power 
is inside you, why isn't your life amazing? Why isn't every area 
of your life magnificent? Why don't you have everything you 
want? Why haven't you been able to do everything you want 
to do? Why aren't you filled with joy every day? </b>
The answer is: because you have a choice. You have a 
choice whether to love and harness the positive force - or 
not. And whether you realize it or not, every day of your life every moment of your life - you have been making this 
choice. </p>

<p>Every single time you experienced 
something good in your life, you loved and harnessed love's 
positive force. And every single time you experienced 
something not good, you didn't love, and the result was 
negativity. Love is the cause of all the good things in your life, 
and a lack of love is the cause of all the negative things,
all the pain and suffering.</p>

        <h2>The Law of Love</h2>
        <p>To harness the positive force of love and change your 
life, you must understand its law, the most powerful law in the 
universe - the law of attraction.  </p> 

<p>
From the greatest to the smallest - the law of attraction 
is what holds every star in the universe and forms every atom 
and molecule. The force of attraction of the sun holds the 
planets in our solar system, keeping them from hurtling into 
space. The force of attraction in gravity holds you and every 
person, animal, plant, and mineral on earth. The force of 
attraction can be seen in all of nature.The force 
of attraction operates through all the animals on the earth, 
fish in the sea, and birds in the sky, leading them to multiply 
and form herds, schools, and flocks.</p> 

<p> The force of attraction 
holds together the cells of your body, the materials of your 
house, and the furniture you sit on, and it holds your car to 
the road and the water in your glass. Every object you use is 
held together by the force of attraction. </p>
<p>
Attraction is the force that draws people to other people. 
It draws people to form cities and nations, groups, clubs, and 
societies where they share common interests. It is the force 
that pulls one person to science and another to cooking; it 
pulls people to various sports or to different styles of music, 
to certain animals and pets. Attraction is the force that draws
you to your favorite things and places, and it's the force that 
draws you to your friends and the people you love.</p>

        <h2>
The Attractive Force of Love </h2>
       
<p> The law of attraction is the law of love, and it is the all-
powerful law that keeps everything in harmony, from countless 
galaxies to atoms.In universal terms, the law of attraction says: <b><em>"like attracts 
like".</em></b> What that means in simple terms for your life is: what 
you give out, you receive back. Whatever you give out in life is 
what you receive back in life. Whatever you give, by the law 
of attraction, is exactly what you attract back to yourself.</p>

<img src="power1.jpg" alt="Follow on Instagram" class="img-fluid" style="width: 50%; height: auto;" />

        <p>There is no doubt in <em><b>"THE POWER - LOVE".</b></em> The law of attraction is the law of love. It's true. It's simply a law; it is not called the "miracle of attraction" or the "magic of attraction." It's called  "law of attraction." You believe in Newton's law, gravitational law, right? Why? Because you know they are truths; they are simply called laws—they have certain principles, and you believe in them. The same applies to the "law of attraction." It works based on principle. Whatever you give will return to you at lightning speed. If you give love, joy, and happiness, you will receive the same. If you give negative emotions like fear, doubt, frustration, and hopelessness, you will receive the same, but in terms of different circumstances and events that make you feel the same way.
<br><br>
Prosperity is your birthright, and you hold the key to more abundance. You deserve every good thing you want and the universe will give you every good thing you want. But there is a condition - first you have to give , to get it back. You cannot trick the universe and the law of attraction. Your giving must be sincere and you must feel it in your heart. <br> <br>

 •If you want more money, you have to give more money. <br>
 •If you want more time, you should spend time helping people. <br>
 •If you want more happiness and peace, you should spread happiness. <br> 
 •If you want more success, help others succeed. <br>
 •If you want more respect, show respect to those around you. <br>
 •If you want more love, you must give love. <br>
 •If you want more knowledge, you should share what you know. <br> </p>

  <h2> Giving back </h2>
<p> The happiness you feel in knowing you have helped another human being will never leave you. The joy and happiness you feel is so great that it can make you question the entire purpose of your life. In fact, the purpose of your life is joy, and so what do you think is the greatest joy in life? <b> <em>Giving! </b> </em> <br> <br>

If your financial situation does not allow you to give more money, there are a lot of alternatives which are equally powerful as giving money : <br> 
•Give love and appreciation to people. <br>
•Give gratitude for what you have. <br>
•Give a helping hand, give a kind of gesture, give a smile and give the best of yourself to everyone you meet. <br>
•Give kind words. <br>
•Give a smile. <br>

In simple terms, Newton's law states that "what you give is what you receive", it doesn't state " What you receive is what you give".
As you give everything with love, the law of attraction must return to you the sheer joy and happiness of everything you want and love.

        <p class="note">I know some people find it hard to trust this kind of logic, and many can't believe what the author is saying. However, if there is any proof , people are more likely to believe it. I've included a link here that shows numerous people who practiced manifestation using the law of attraction and shared their experiences.<br>
